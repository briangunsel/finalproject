# finalproject

For my project, I created a simple Flask application that utilized Flask, of course, Python, HTML, CSS, and the OpenWeather API. From this project, I learned the basics of Flask, API's with Json, and the basics of virtual environements which is what I used to run my web app on locally. It is much simpler than I would have liked. Originally, I wanted to implement a MongoDB database, but I was not familiar with it and did not want to mess up and have to start from scratch, so I stuck with the simplified version. This was my first time working with flask and using an API, so the first thing I did was read the entire Flask documenation on the official website, which contained everything I needed to know about Jinja templating, routing, and especially how to use Json to extract data from an API, which in this case was the OpenWeather API. The hardest challenge specifically, was that it took me a few hours to figure out the best way to get the user's input and send it back to flask. Originally, I was going to use JavaScript with jQuery but ended up searching the Flask documentation and found the easiest solution without having to implement JavaScript. Overall, I'm proud in my project given that it was my first time using Flask and creating a web app in general. I am also happy with how clean it turned out and the minimal styling.
