# README! - Final Project

For my project, I created a simple Flask application that utilized Flask, of course, Python, HTML, CSS, and the OpenWeather API. From this project, I learned the basics of Flask, API's with Json, and the basics of virtual environements which is what I used to run my web app on locally. The hardest challenge specifically, was that it took me a few hours to figure out the best way to get the user's input and send it back to flask. Originally, I was going to use JavaScript with jQuery but ended up searching the Flask documentation and found the easiest solution without having to implement JavaScript. 

It is much simpler than I would have liked. Originally, I wanted to implement a MongoDB database to store your saved cities, but I was not familiar with it and did not want to mess up and have to start from scratch, so I stuck with the simplified version. This was my first time working with flask and using an API, so the first thing I did was read the entire Flask documenation on the official website, which contained everything I needed to know about Jinja templating, routing, and especially how to use Json to extract data from an API, which in this case was the OpenWeather API.

Overall, I'm proud in my project given that it was my first time using Flask and creating a web app in general. I am also happy with how clean it turned out and the minimal styling. This project helped me to learn new technologies and also gave me insight on how Python is used in more than just command line applications.

Th folder titled "Final", located in my repository, is where you can find all of my code. The main python file and backend of my program is "main.py", and there are three html templates. "city.html" contains Python as well, in a jinja2 templating structure. NOTE: When creating the virtual environment for my program, it created a large folder structure within my main folder, so I had to remove that before uploading all of my work to github.
